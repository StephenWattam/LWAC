Schemata
========
These schemata describe the various tables within a corpus' metadata database.  Some of the fields are configurable in server config files, and can be edited, however, others should be retained (until a later version of LWAC supports changing them).  The safest thing is not to touch any existing stuff.

If you wish for the import tool to create more tables within the database, create a new .sql file in this directory.
