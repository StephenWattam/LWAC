Welcome to the LWAC user guide.  The purpose of this document is to explain some of the design concepts used, provide recipes for common tasks, and explain some of the technical capacities/limitations of LWAC.

Installation and Dependencies
-----------------------------
LWAC's dependencies and installer are documented [here](install.html)

Concepts
--------
The [concepts](concepts.html) used in the model are explained here.

Tools
-----
LWAC consists of a number of [tools](tools.html), and these are explained individually here.

Workflows
---------
LWAC's [workflow](workflows.html) was designed around longitudinal sampling.  Some common methods are explained here.

Process Monitoring
------------------
LWAC is designed for longitudinal sampling, and as such a process monitor is a good idea to ensure that you are notified in case of any problems. [Monitoring and maintenance](monitoring.html) has its own section.

Limits and Performance
----------------------
See some rough indications on what [limits LWAC's performance](limits.html)

Bugs and Suggestions
--------------------
Please get in touch by reporting bugs to [my issue tracker](http://stephenwattam.com/issues/), or [email me](http://stephenwattam.com/contact/).  Please do this if you notice something---I relish the opportunity to fix it.

If you can write code, feel free to submit a patch or contact me for your own branch in the git repository.  There's a space in the authors listing for your name :-)

License and Usage Conditions
----------------------------
I consider LWAC open source for personal, educational, and "semi-commercial" use on condition that you:

 * Do not make money from directly selling the code (including as part of something else).
 * Do not make money from selling corpora built using LWAC without first [contacting me for permission](http://stephenwattam.com/contact/).  I'll probably say yes.
 * Credit LWAC and provide a link to [http://stephenwattam.com/project/LWAC/](http://stephenwattam.com/project/LWAC/) or [ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/LWAC/](ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/LWAC/) in any publications (You can also cite the paper pending for WaC8, once it's published).
 * Don't use it as a DDOS system.

Other than that, knock yourself out.  The code's fairly clean, and fairly well documented.
